# PcBuildTool
This is a software engineering semester 2 project made in ASP.NET.
It has a basic MVC pattern in the front-end and a DAL, Domain, Factory and Logic pattern in the back-end.

### Front-end
The front-end uses Razor to make dynamic webpages. It also uses Bootstrap to make the pages dynamic for mobile and desktop and to make it look nicer.

### Back-end
The back-end uses [Dapper](https://dapper-tutorial.net/) to convert a SQL query result to a class.
